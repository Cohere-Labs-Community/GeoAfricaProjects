# **Project: Speech-to-Speech for Low-Resource Languages**

## **1\. Objective**

This project aims to investigate and develop a viable pipeline for creating efficient and high-quality speech-to-speech systems for low-resource languages, with an initial focus on African languages. The core of this investigation involves two main streams:

1. **Identifying State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Models:** Researching the most advanced, adaptable, and efficient models for Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) that can be fine-tuned for languages with limited data.  
2. **Exploring Synthetic Data Generation:** Investigating voice cloning and synthetic data generation platforms to create high-quality, accent-preserved audio data. This synthetic data will be used to augment the limited existing datasets, enabling more robust model training.

The ultimate goal is to create a reproducible workflow for bootstrapping STT and TTS capabilities in any low-resource language.

## **2\. Part 1: State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Speech Models**

The following table summarizes the most promising models for STT and TTS, particularly for multilingual and low-resource contexts.

| Model Name | Type | Key Features & Strengths | Data Requirements for Fine-Tuning | Fine-Tuning & Caveats |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **NVIDIA Canary** | STT | \- High-quality multilingual and multitask (ASR \+ Translation).\<br\>- Fast inference.\<br\>- Open-source models available. | Trained on massive datasets (e.g., Granary with \~1M hours). Fine-tuning on a smaller, high-quality dataset is the standard approach. | \- Requires powerful hardware (NVIDIA GPUs).\<br\>- The NeMo toolkit provides scripts and tutorials for fine-tuning.\<br\>- Primarily focused on European languages so far, but the architecture is adaptable. |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | STT | \- Robust to noise and accents.\<br\>- Excellent zero-shot performance on many languages.\<br\>- Large, medium, small, and tiny versions available. | Can be fine-tuned on as little as a few hours of high-quality, transcribed audio to significantly improve performance for a specific language. | \- Relatively straightforward to fine-tune using Hugging Face Transformers.\<br\>- Normalizing text (e.g., handling numbers, symbols) is crucial for good results.\<br\>- The base model's knowledge can sometimes "overpower" the fine-tuning data if not done carefully. |
| **Meta MMS** | STT & TTS | \- Massive language coverage (\>1,100 languages for STT/TTS).\<br\>- Specifically designed for low-resource languages.\<br\>- Outperforms Whisper in low-resource benchmarks. | Trained on religious texts (like the Bible) due to wide translation availability. Can be fine-tuned with domain-specific data. | \- The model's training data may introduce a domain bias (religious context).\<br\>- Fine-tuning is essential for conversational or technical speech.\<br\>- The quality for any single language may vary. |
| **Orpheus** | TTS | \- Built on a Llama backbone, demonstrating emergent capabilities.\<br\>- Zero-shot voice cloning.\<br\>- Controllable emotion and intonation. | Pre-trained on 100k+ hours of English data. Fine-tuning for new languages would require a high-quality single-speaker dataset. | \- Open-source and highly capable, but primarily English-focused.\<br\>- Adapting to a new, low-resource language would be a significant undertaking, likely requiring more than just fine-tuning. |
| **Higgs Audio V2** | TTS | \- Industry-leading expressive audio generation.\<br\>- Multilingual voice cloning.\<br\>- Built on Llama 3, open-source. | Pre-trained on over 10 million hours of audio. | \- A very large and powerful model, likely requiring significant computational resources to run and fine-tune.\<br\>- Its multilingual capabilities make it a strong candidate for experimentation. |

## **3\. Part 2: Voice Cloning & Synthetic Data Generation**

To augment limited datasets, synthetic data generation is a promising approach. The platforms below are leaders in voice cloning and TTS, with some offering features suitable for preserving diverse accents.

| Platform/Tool | Key Features | Suitability for African Accents | Use Case for this Project |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **ElevenLabs** | \- High-quality, natural-sounding voices.\<br\>- Voice cloning from short audio samples.\<br\>- Supports 28 languages and 50+ accents. | Good. While not explicitly focused on African accents, its accent cloning capabilities are powerful and can likely capture and replicate them with high fidelity from provided samples. | Generate a large, consistent dataset from a single cloned voice actor. This provides a clean base for initial model training. |
| **Podcastle** | \- Offers a range of African AI voices out-of-the-box.\<br\>- Text-to-speech with in-built audio editing tools.\<br\>- Transcribes existing audio/video. | Excellent. Explicitly provides and markets African voices, suggesting a focus on authentic representation for these accents. | A good source for pre-existing, high-quality African voices. Can be used to generate diverse training data without needing to find and record voice actors first. |
| **Cartesia** | \- Real-time voice generation (low latency).\<br\>- Advanced voice cloning (3 seconds for instant, 30 mins for professional).\<br\>- Strong competitor to ElevenLabs, often preferred for naturalness. | Good. Similar to ElevenLabs, its strength lies in its cloning technology. If you provide a high-quality sample of an African accent, it should be able to replicate it effectively. | Useful for creating interactive applications later on, but also a strong contender for generating the primary training dataset. |
| **Cloud Provider TTS** | \- Google Cloud TTS, Azure TTS, AWS Polly.\<br\>- Offer a wide variety of standard voices and languages.\<br\>- Reliable, scalable, and well-documented APIs. | Moderate. They offer some regional voices (e.g., Nigerian English), but the selection is limited compared to specialized platforms. The accent may sound more generic. | Good for generating a baseline dataset or for applications where a standard, clear voice is sufficient. Less ideal for preserving specific, nuanced accents. |

## **4\. Proposed Next Steps & Methodology**

This project can proceed by following a structured, iterative approach:

1. **Phase 1: Data Collection & Scoping**  
   * **Select a Target Language:** Choose a specific low-resource language to focus on for the initial proof-of-concept.  
   * **Acquire a Seed Dataset:** Gather a small, high-quality dataset of transcribed audio for this language (even 1-2 hours is a good start). This can come from existing open-source datasets (e.g., Mozilla Common Voice), or through new recordings.  
2. **Phase 2: Synthetic Data Augmentation**  
   * **Select a Voice Cloning Platform:** Based on the table above, choose a platform (e.g., Podcastle for existing voices, ElevenLabs for cloning a specific actor).  
   * **Clone a Voice:** If necessary, use the seed dataset to clone a consistent, high-quality voice that accurately reflects the target accent.  
   * **Generate Synthetic Audio:** Use a large corpus of text in the target language to generate thousands of hours of synthetic audio data with the cloned voice.  
3. **Phase 3: Model Fine-Tuning**  
   * **Select a Base Model:** Choose a model from the SOTA list. **OpenAI Whisper (for STT)** and **Meta MMS (for TTS)** are strong initial candidates due to their proven low-resource capabilities.  
   * **Prepare the Data:** Combine the small, real dataset with the large, synthetic dataset.  
   * **Fine-Tune:** Train the selected models on this combined dataset. The goal is for the model to learn the language's nuances from the real data while generalizing from the vastness of the synthetic data.  
4. **Phase 4: Evaluation and Iteration**  
   * **STT Evaluation:** Measure the performance of the fine-tuned STT model using Word Error Rate (WER) on a held-out test set of real audio.  
   * **TTS Evaluation:** Measure the performance of the TTS model using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for naturalness and intelligibility.  
   * **Iterate:** Based on the results, experiment with different models, data ratios (real vs. synthetic), and fine-tuning techniques.
